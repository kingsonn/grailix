GRAILIX — MVP PROJECT SPECIFICATION
Project Summary

Grailix is a swipe-based AI-driven prediction market game.
Users swipe Agree / Disagree / Skip on financial predictions generated by AI from real analysts.
They stake credits (free or crypto-backed) and earn payouts using a pari-mutuel pool.
Each prediction has a predictionHash and outcomeHash recorded on-chain for fairness.

The product is:

simple to use (swipe cards)

addictive (XP, streaks, rewards)

trust-enhanced (AI + blockchain hash proofs)
